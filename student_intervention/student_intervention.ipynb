    "The supervised learning models that are appropriate for this problem are Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM's have broad applications in healthcare research and bioinformatics.  Using \"diabetes risk variables such as family history, age, gender, race and ethnicity, weight, height, waist circumference, BMI, hypertension, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, education, and household income,\" researchers have used SVMs to identify both cases of diabetes and pre-diabetes.<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "A strength of the SVM is the ability to remain effective even in high dimension spaces, which is helpful as the student intervention dataset has 300 training examples and  30 features (48 features after conversion of categorical variables).  This is not a high dimensional space, but the number of features is high relative to number of training examples.  Training is relatively easy and the trade-off between complexity and overfitting can be manually controlled using the 'C' parameter.  The 'kernel trick' can be used to transform data to a higher dimension so that it is linearly separable.  In theory, the SVM seeks to find a high-margin classifier, so it naturally works against over-fitting.  The algorithm is also relatively tolerant of diverse input feature data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weaknesses of SVMs are they can be slow to train and the user may need to optimize the parameters of 'C' and 'gamma' to achieve the best classification results.  The memory requirements for the algorithm are high.  SVM's perform poorly when the classes are highly skewed or when there are multiple classes.  The dataset is only slightly skewed with 2/3 of the population passing and 1/3 failing.  SVM's also perform poorly if features are not properly scaled.  This should not be a problem in the dataset as most of the data is categorical.  The only feature which might benefit from scaling is absences.  Lastly, depending on the kernel, an SVM might overfit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification can be applied to spam/ham email categorization, text recognition, and image recognition.  This algorithm can also be used to \"automatically identifying stroke lesions in individual T1-weighted MRI scans... Probabilistic tissue segmentation and image algebra were used to create feature maps encoding information about missing and abnormal tissue.\"<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest atraction of Gaussian Naive Bayes is that it is simple, fast to train/classify, and performs reasonbaly well for its straightforwardness.  Further benefits of this approach are that it works well with categorical input variables and small data sets, which are two features in the data.  Most of the 48 features in the dataset are categorical and the number of data points present is low relative to the feature set.  Naive Bayes also is less prone to overfitting as the hypothesis is simple, and errs on the side of high bias.  It can also classify correctly even if the strong independence assumptions are violated, which could be the case for several features relating to the student's family and socioeconomic background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paradoxically, demerits of Naive Bayes include the fact that if independence assumptions do not hold, the classifier could perform poorly (though frequently it still performs well).  In addition, the learner cannot accurately model interactions between features.  The features use should be normally distributed, however, in the dataset, this assumption is violated by absences and age (see histograms in the next cell).  Lastly, because it does not overfit, the algorithm exihibits low variance.  It may be difficult to improve the algorithm by adding training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests are a relatively new innovation in machine learning, and are an ensemble of categorization trees.  Some applications include classification of internet traffic, bioinformatics (gene expression classification, mass spectrum protein expression analysis, biomarker discovery, sequence annotation, protein-protein interaction prediction), and customer segmentation.  A specific application is using environmental variables (topograhpy and weather) to predict the presence of invasive species.<sup>3</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of random forests is that it is ideal for complex classification problems and easy to use with minimal tinkering.  With many trees 'voting' for classification features, random forests will not overfit the way a categorization and regression tree can.  The number of trees generated ensures that high-bias trees and high-variance trees will not skew the classification.  The algorithm works well with large databases (high dimensional spaces and a large number of training examples).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of RF is that a large number of trees may slow down real-time learning.  The method has also been known to overfit noisy classification tasks.  Conversely, because it is easy to use, there are few parameters to tune and the modeler has very little control over the learning algorithm.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."

    "Based upon the experiments, the model that should be chosen is the Support Vector Machine classifier.  The criteria for choosing the best model is the array of F1 scores using the test data.  The F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, serves as a good metric of accuracy for the classifier.  The F1 score for the test data, and not the training data, is utilized as the learning algorithm has not 'seen' the test data.  Thus, overfitting of the training data can be avoided and the choice of classifier can be objective.\n",

    "The Support Vector Machine classifier works by looking at training data points and finding a boundary which can divide one group (passing students) from another (failing students).  Furthermore, the algorithm works to maximize the distance between data points which are close to the boundary.  This gives the boundary a 'buffer' which is as large as possible from the nearest points.  Another way to state this is the algorithm places the highest importance on 'difficult' training data points which are closest to the opposite group when drawing the dividing line.\n",

    "Once the boundary is chosen using the training data, test data points are overlaid in the same exact space, and the pre-existing boundary is used to classify them to one group or the other.
