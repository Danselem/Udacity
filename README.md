# Udacity

A repository holding code and notes for projects for in the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.

I am hoping to find a position in data science or machine learning after completing this course of study.

Projects:
* [Predicting Titanic Survival](https://github.com/KT12/Udacity/tree/master/titanic_survival_exploration) - exploratory analysis, decision trees
* [Valuation of Boston Housing](https://github.com/KT12/Udacity/tree/master/boston_housing) - linear regression, feature engineering
* [Designing a Student Intervention System](https://github.com/KT12/Udacity/tree/master/student_intervention) - feature selection, classification, visualization
* ['In class' clustering mini-project](https://github.com/KT12/Udacity/tree/master/clustering_mini-project) - unsupervised learning
* [Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/KT12/Udacity/tree/master/customer_segments) - clustering, Gaussian mixed models, PCA and dimensionality reduction
* [Training a 'smart' cab](https://github.com/KT12/Udacity/tree/master/smartcab) - reinforcement learning, Q-learning, optimization
* [Deep Learning and Tensorflow Unit](https://github.com/KT12/Udacity/tree/master/ud_370) - Tensorflow, neural networks, convolutional neural networks, word2vec, LSTM's
* [Capstone: Headlines and Stock Price Movements](https://github.com/KT12/Udacity/tree/master/capstone) - natural language processing, classification, sentiment analysis
